# Tkinter Desktop Application Guide

## Overview

The Tkinter desktop application provides a graphical interface for entering, managing, and distributing KPI targets. It is focused solely on data entry and target repartition, not on visualization or analytics.

## How to Launch

1. Navigate to the project root directory.
2. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python main.py tkinter
    ```

3. The application window will open, providing access to all features through a tabbed interface.

## Main Sections

-   **üéØ Inserimento Target (Target Entry):**
    -   Set annual targets for KPIs, specifying the year and facility.
    -   Choose a distribution profile (e.g., annual progressive, even distribution) to allocate the annual target across different periods.
    -   Define repartition logic (monthly, quarterly, weekly) to further refine the target distribution.
    -   Manually override target values for specific sub-KPIs in a master-subordinate relationship.

-   **üóÇÔ∏è Gestione Gerarchia KPI (KPI Hierarchy Management):**
    -   Define a hierarchical structure for KPIs by creating groups, subgroups, and individual indicators.
    -   Add, edit, and delete KPI groups, subgroups, and indicators.
    -   Assign indicators to specific subgroups to categorize and organize KPIs.

-   **üìã Gestione Template Indicatori (Indicator Template Management):**
    -   Create reusable templates for KPI indicators to streamline the KPI creation process.
    -   Define default calculation types, units of measure, and visibility settings for indicators within a template.
    -   Apply templates to KPI subgroups to automatically create and configure indicators based on the template definition.

-   **‚öôÔ∏è Gestione Specifiche KPI (KPI Specification Management):**
    -   Define detailed specifications for each KPI, including a description, calculation type, unit of measure, and visibility setting.
    -   Specify whether a KPI is visible for target entry, controlling its availability in the target setting section.
    -   Link KPIs to specific indicators to associate them with the defined KPI hierarchy.

-   **üîó Gestione Link Master/Sub (Master/Sub KPI Linking):**
    -   Establish master-subordinate relationships between KPIs to enable weighted target distribution.
    -   Define a distribution weight for each sub-KPI to control its share of the master KPI's target.
    -   Easily manage and visualize the master-subordinate relationships between KPIs.

-   **üè≠ Gestione Stabilimenti (Facility Management):**
    -   Manage a list of facilities for which KPI targets are tracked.
    -   Add, edit, and delete facilities.
    -   Specify whether a facility is visible for target entry, controlling its availability in the target setting section.

-   **üìà Analisi Risultati (Results Analysis):**
    -   View and analyze KPI targets and their repartitions.
    -   Switch between single KPI analysis (for a specific plant) and global KPI dashboard views.
    -   Visualize data using charts and tables.

-   **üì¶ Esportazione Dati (Data Export):**
    -   Export KPI target data in CSV, Excel, or ZIP format for use in external reporting or dashboard tools.
    -   Import KPI data from CSV files, with automatic recalculation of derived fields.

## Notes

-   The application currently focuses on data entry and target repartition. While the framework supports visualization, this implementation does not yet include comprehensive dashboards or charts. (This is a planned future enhancement).
-   All data is stored locally in SQLite databases.
-   For troubleshooting, check the application logs or contact the maintainer.
